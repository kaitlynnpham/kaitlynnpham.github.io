                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Kaitlynn and I recently graduated from the University of Nevada-Las Vegas,
                    with a degree in Computer Science and Kinesiology. Over the past two years, I've honed my
                    programming skills in C++ and Python, applying them to develop innovative solutions in both academic
                    and professional settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my internship at Koshee AI, I had the opportunity to design and implement an area
                    coverage algorithm, capable of navigating around obstacles. This experience not only reinforced my
                    problem-solving abilities but also deepened my interest in integrating technology with real-world
                    applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am eager to leverage my technical expertise and passion for healthcare technology to contribute to
                    projects that make a meaningful impact. Beyond my academic pursuits, I am deeply passionate about
                    designing engaging projects, particularly in game development.

                            Project Overview:
                        </h4>
                        During my internship, I collaborated with a team to develop an autonomous robot designed to be
                        equipped with a pressure washer system for cleaning pool decks. Our primary challenge was to
                        design a navigation system that could effectively maneuver around obstacles while ensuring
                        complete coverage of the area.

                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>Area Coverage Algorithm: I developed an area coverage algorithm using the A* Search
                                method
                                that was integrated into Madara Middleware. This technique allowed the robot to
                                navigate
                                efficiently,
                                avoid obstacles, and fully cover a defined area.

                            <li> LiDAR Integration for Object Detection: I utilized LiDAR to capture point clouds and
                                applied plane segmentation to identify flat surfaces. Using the PCL (Point Cloud
                                Library), I extracted Euclidean clusters to group objects and determine their locations
                                on a 2D grid map. This approach enabled effective object detection and localization for
                                the autonomous robot.

                            <li> GPS Waypoint Generation: We integrated a GPS system using the Emlid Reach RS3 to
                                accurately capture the latitude and longitude of objects. The receivers tracked the
                                robot's location, which allowed me to convert the LiDAR Cartesian coordinates into GPS
                                coordinates. This data was then combined with the area coverage algorithm to enable
                                precise waypoint navigation.

                        determine if we could reliably predict diabetes based on various health, lifestyle, and
                        socioeconomic factors. The dataset we used categorizes individuals into three groups: diabetes,
                        pre-diabetes, and healthy. It also includes a range of features for each individual. The model
                        was able to
                        achieve an average accuracy of 85% in predicting diabetes.
