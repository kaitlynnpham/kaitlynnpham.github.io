                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Kaitlynn and I recently graduated from the University of Nevada-Las Vegas,
                    with a degree in Computer Science and Kinesiology. Over the past two years, I've honed my
                    programming skills in C++ and Python, applying them to develop innovative solutions in both academic
                    and professional settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had the opportunity to design and implement an area coverage algorithm that enables navigation
                    around obstacles. This experience not only strengthened my problem-solving skills but also deepened
                    my interest in applying technology to real-world challenges. I am excited to leverage my technical
                    expertise and passion for both healthcare technology and creative projects.

                        </h4>
                        During my internship, I collaborated with a team to develop an autonomous robot designed to be
                        equipped with a pressure washer system for cleaning pool decks. Our primary challenge was to
                        design a navigation system that could effectively maneuver around obstacles while ensuring
                        complete coverage of the area.

                                area.
                                The algorithm was integrated with Madara Middlware and utilized sensor data from Mid-360
                                LiDAR and Emlid GNSS.
                                This methodology to use A-Star was inspired by academic research found here: <a

                            <li> LiDAR Integration for Object Detection: I utilized LiDAR to capture point clouds and
                                applied plane segmentation to identify flat surfaces. Using the PCL (Point Cloud
                                Library), I extracted Euclidean clusters to group objects and determine their locations
                                on a 2D grid map. This approach enabled effective object detection and localization for
                                the autonomous robot.

                            <li> GPS Waypoint Generation: We integrated a GPS system using the Emlid Reach RS3 to
                                accurately capture the latitude and longitude of objects. The receivers tracked the
                                robot's location, which allowed me to convert the LiDAR Cartesian coordinates into GPS
                                coordinates. This data was then combined with the area coverage algorithm to enable
                                precise waypoint navigation.

                        <p>
                            This project contains a Forge app that displays in a Jira issue
                            panel. It shows a table of related bug tickets and includes a custom "Create Ticket"
                            button. The primary goal of this app is to streamline bug tracking while preventing
                            clutter on the main project board.
                        </p>
                        <p>The main board is reserved for system-wide or project-level bugs, not for minor issues like
                            fixes related to individual tickets (e.g., feature
                            enhancements or small improvements). Previously, the quality analysis team would document
                            these smaller issues by leaving comments on the original tickets. This approach made it
                            difficult to track
                            workload and manage bug resolution effectively.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, Jira automation was not a viable solution. It does not support a rich text
                            editor
                            in ticket descriptions and does not automatically open the newly created ticket. This adds
                            extra
                            manual effort for the QA team, who must locate the ticket afterward and manually add
                            screenshots
                            or apply formatting.
                        </p>
                        <p>This app addresses that pain point by providing a custom "Create Ticket" link that preloads
                            the necessary fields and opens the ticket creation page directly.

                            Project Overview:
                        </h4>
                        For this project, I collaborated with a team to develop a neural network model aimed at
                        predicting whether an individual has diabetes. Our goal was to
                        determine if we could reliably predict diabetes based on various health, lifestyle, and
                        socioeconomic factors. The dataset we used categorizes individuals into three groups: diabetes,
                        pre-diabetes, and healthy. It also includes a range of features for each individual. The model
                        was able to
                        achieve an average accuracy of 85% in predicting diabetes.

                                Conducted correlation analysis and created visualizations using Python and
                                Pandas to analyze the relationships between key features, helping guide feature
                                selection and model development.

                                Leveraged PyTorch for training the neural network model, and used Matplotlib to
                                visualize the training vs. validation accuracy and training vs. validation loss over
                                500 epochs. These visualizations provided valuable insights into model performance,
                                helping identify potential issues such as overfitting and underfitting.
